                <h4>Peace Bonding</h4>
                <p>Prop Weapons must be submitted to “Weapons’ Check” for Peace Bonding. TsumiCon has the sole
                    discretion to approve Prop
                    Weapons. Please visit us at our Weapons’ Check Booth during the convention. Locations are to be
                    determined and announced
                    on our website at www.TsumiCon.com. </p>
                <p>We may revoke your Peace Bond at any time in our sole discretion. Behavior which will warrant
                    revocation of your Peace
                    Bond includes, but not limited to:</p>
                <p>Brandishing an item in an inappropriate fashion, such as play-fighting or swinging the prop around
                </p>
                <p>Causing complaints from other attendees</p>
                <p>Tampering or altering of the Peace Bond</p>
                <p>Prop weapons are inoperable weapons that support the overall look of your costume or character. For
                    example, plastic
                    airsoft guns, nerf guns, water guns, dart guns, disc guns, pellet guns, and cap guns are prop
                    weapons.</p>
                <p>If a prop weapon is, or was, at any time capable of firing anything, it must be rendered permanently
                    inoperable in order
                    to qualify for Peace Bonding. You can do this by, for example, permanently plugging the barrel with
                    glue, caulk, or any
                    non-removable substance and hot gluing all moving components of the prop in place. You must be able
                    to prove that the
                    prop weapon is permanently inoperable upon inspection.</p>
                <p>In addition, to qualify for Peace Bonding, your prop weapon must meet the following criteria:</p>
                <p>All bladed props, prop firearms, and prop knives cannot contain metal, have metal components, or have
                    metal-based paints
                    on them.</p>
                <p>Note: Lightsabers with metal hilts are allowed.</p>
                <p>Your prop weapon cannot be more than 7 feet (2.13 meters) in any direction or weigh more than 15
                    pounds (6.8 kilograms).</p>
                <p>Prop explosives or ammunition cannot be made out of metal.</p>
                <p>All swords and bladed prop weapons must adhere to the following rules:</p>
                <p>They cannot be made out of metal.</p>
                <p>If your non-metal blade has a sharp edge or pointed tip, it must be anchored to a hard sheath for the
                    duration of the
                    convention.</p>
                <p>If you do not have a hard sheath, your non-metal blade must have a blunt edge and blunt tip.</p>
                <p>All prop arrows must have blunt non-metal tips.</p>
                <p>Metal chains are not permitted, unless it is for cosplay and affixed to a piece of clothing and/or
                    armor.</p>
                <p>Any prop chain must be under 7 feet (2.13 meters) to avoid safety and fire hazards.</p>
                <p>If your prop weapon is a toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm, then federal regulations (15 CFR §
                    272.3) require that
                    it either be translucent enough to permit unmistakable observation of the device’s complete contents
                    or must have at
                    least one of the following:</p>
                <p>An Orange Solid Plug in Barrel: Have a blaze orange (Fed-Std-595B 12199) or orange color brighter
                    than that specified by
                    the federal standard color number solid plug permanently affixed to the muzzle end of the barrel as
                    an integral part of
                    the entire device and recessed no more than 6 millimeters from the muzzle end of the barrel; OR</p>
                <p>An Orange Barrel Marking: A blaze orange (Fed-Std-595B 12199) or orange color brighter than that
                    specified by the
                    federal standard color number, marking permanently affixed to the exterior surface of the barrel,
                    covering the
                    circumference of the barrel from the muzzle end for a depth of at least 6 millimeters; OR</p>
                <p>Entire Surface Coloration: Coloration of the entire exterior surface of the device in white, bright
                    red, bright orange,
                    bright yellow, bright green, bright blue, bright pink, or bright purple, either singly or as the
                    predominant color in
                    combination with other colors in any pattern.</p>
                <p>Please take care when outside or when transporting any form of firearm prop.</p>
                <p>Regardless of how realistic the prop may look, ensure that it is completely hidden while traveling
                    and be aware of your
                    surroundings, attire, and the appearance of your props to bystanders when outside of the convention.
                    Do not assume a
                    costume will reassure people that your prop is not a real weapon.</p>
                <p>You may display your prop weapons only as costume pieces. Do not swing or brandish your prop weapon
                    in any way that
                    could be considered unsafe or threatening.
                </p>
                <p>You may pose with a prop weapon in a brandishing manner, so long as no reasonable person would
                    interpret it as anything
                    but a pose for dramatic effect. Convention staff or management may stop your posed brandishing in
                    their sole discretion.</p>
                <p>Please put your prop weapons away when leaving the event facilities at night so that you don’t
                    receive the attention of
                    local law enforcement. TsumiCon cannot be responsible for any actions taken by local law enforcement
                    agencies, such as
                    detaining and questioning you, if you decide to display or brandish your prop weapons at or outside
                    of the event
                    facilities.</p>
                <h4>Everyday Items</h4>
                <p>Items that people normally carry such as umbrellas or walking sticks/canes are permitted within the
                    convention and
                    subject to inspection upon entry.</p>
                <p>Lightweight plastic or foam bats, paddles, and clubs are permitted.</p>
                <p>Roller skates/blades, skateboards, scooters, go-karts, hoverboards, etc. are not permitted within the

                <p>Power tools are not permitted, e.g. chainsaws, drills, or hedge trimmers.</p>
                <h4>Buying Weapons at the Event</h4>
                <p>All Prop / Replica Weapons purchased at the convention must remain sealed in its original packaging
                    while at the
                    convention. If you would like to use your Prop / Replica Weapon at the Event, you must submit your
                    item to a “Weapons’
                    Check” Booth for peace bonding.</p>
                <h4>Martial Arts Performances and Demos</h4>
                <p>You may display working martial arts weapons during, and 30 minutes before and after, a performance
                    that has been
                    approved by convention management in advance.</p>
                <p>Of course, you must use common sense to avoid harming any person or property. You must conceal or
                    wrap the weapons when
                    transporting them to and from the demonstration, and you must remove the weapons immediately after
                    the demonstration.
                    Convention staff reserves the right to stop any performance or demonstration in their sole
                    discretion.</p>
                <h4>Law Enforcement Uniformed Costumes</h4>
                <p>COSTUMES THAT MAY BE CONFUSED WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL
                    UNIFORMS ARE NOT
                    PERMITTED AT THE CONVENTION.</p>
                <p>It is against the law to impersonate local law enforcement, emergency personnel, or first responders.
                    TsumiCon has the
                    absolute right and sole discretion to decide whether your costume looks too much like one of these
                    uniforms, and to
                    request the removal or modification of that costume. Should you refuse to cooperate, we may expel
                    you from the
                    convention in order to protect the safety and welfare of everyone at the convention. </p>
